## Overview

A school assignment turned into a personal project. Learning how to plan and develop a game with full creative scope. We builed a top down 2D dungeon crawler puzzle game, The Forgotten Knight. Complete with music, sound effects, and animations this project has turned into an exciting creative outlet for us. From trouble shooting our collision detection to implementing multiple levels, we have learned a lot in building out this project.

Our primary focus in this project was creating a simple and enjoyable game experience while maintaining clean, well documented code. We utilized our class diagram to plan out the project implementation and kept it up-to-date as the project evolved. We also learned a lot from utilizing github for our version control as we collaborated and implemented features simultaneously, resolving merge conflicts along the way.

## Built With :computer:

We utilized the Monogame framework to build this game in C#.
